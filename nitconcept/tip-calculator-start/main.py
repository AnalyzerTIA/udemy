# FAQ: How to round to 2 decimal places?

# Find the answer in the Q&A here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/17965132#questions/13315048

#If you want the final_amount to always have 2 decimal places.
#e.g. $12 becomes $12.00
#You can use this link to figure out how to do this:
#https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-print-a-float-with-two-decimal-places-in-python
#This is how you can implement it:
final_amount = "{:.2f}".format(total_tip_ammount)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
